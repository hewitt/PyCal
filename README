A very simple text-based calendar event tracker. If, like me, you don't
have every second of your day timetabled but do want to keep track
of a handful of events, then most app/web-based calendars are overkill. 
The aim here is to do only very simple things, via text files and CLI.
I wanted to make something that works like todo.sh 
(http://ginatrapani.github.com/todo.txt-cli/) but keeps track of a few 
date-tagged items.

See the top of the code for defaults, including the filename of the
calendar file.

I usually pipe the output to a 'conky' display to keep forthcoming
calendar items on my desktop. Meanwhile, my machines are sync'd by
Unison, which ensures that the cal.txt file is up to date on all
of them. I have PyCal.py aliased to 'c' in the same way that I have
'todo.sh' aliased to 't'.
